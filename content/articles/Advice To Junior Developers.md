**The best advice I wish I knew when starting.**

**You do not have to be a perfectionist**

Being a developer doesn’t mean you have to be a perfectionist and the know it all developer, no. you don’t have to be a perfectionist to master the craft.

**Be patient with your growth. (Sharpening your skills takes time)**

One thing you have to keep in mind is that you won’t be a better developer in a week or month span. To be better you have to be patient with your little growth.

**You do not have to be a nerd to be a developer**

Being a developer doesn't necessarily mean you have to be a nerd in math or a genius so to say. What matters most is your passion and willingness to master the craft which will drive you to achieve more every day.

**The practice is better than watching or reading tutorials.**

A good carpenter isn’t the one that just hangs around but the one that takes up the wood and tries to make an art out of it. Same applies to us, you have to do the dirty work, open that IDE or code editor and write some code. With time you will eventually master the craft.

**Never give Up**

Giving up should not even be the last thing to do. You are going get job rejections now and again, things are not going to work out on your way sometimes but you just need to hold on.

Always remember that with time everything will fall in place and you will catch a break.

Remember the quote “you hang around the barbershop longer enough sooner or later you are going to get a haircut”.

**Being a developer is a long-life learning journey**

New and shiny technologies (frameworks, libraries and languages) are constantly changing now and again and to stay with up to date you need to be willing to push yourself and learn.
Being a developer is like signing a long life learning journey.

Technology is always changing and so should you with the new changes to stay abreast with the new stuff.

**Engage with other developers in your niche.**

This is the part that some people ignore but is very crucial for your growth too. Assume you’re the best in a certain language or framework, who will know you’re the best if you don’t associate with people.

Engaging with other developers also introduces you to other people which might open up opportunities for you. This can be achieved by joining Twitter, Reddit, StackOverflow or LinkedIn groups. For a matter of fact #tech twitter has some amazing people who are ready to help out anytime.

Just to stress on this and as a matter of fact, one of my internships was through a friend I met on Twitter.

**Leverage Google to your best.**

Some people will shame on this but google will always be your go-to for research and consultation. If you encounter some errors, you can quickly leverage google to search for some of your issues.

Remember their maybe someone who had encountered an issue like yours and was willing to give out a solution to the problem they found.

**Pick what you are comfortable with.**

Many people will be bashing and slam shaming how powerful a language or a framework is over the other.
Well does it matter, if they solve the same problem what is the problem with that? My advice to you is to pick what works for you and that which you feel comfortable working with.

After then everything will finally fall in place.

**Never give up**

> Don’t ever give up, don’t ever give in. don’t ever stop trying. don’t ever sell out. And if you find yourself succumbing to one of the above for a brief moment, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, whisper a prayer and start where you left off. But never give up.
